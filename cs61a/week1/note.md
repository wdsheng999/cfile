## 01 assignment
```python
from math import pi 
a=2*pi
```

## 02-functions
defining functions
function v.s. assignment: much powerful way of abstraction
```python
def <name>(<formal params>):
    return expression

```

### looking up environment

environment is sequence of frame
local frame-->global frame

finish textbook 1.1/1.2

- finish installing
- first example

dealing with errors
- test incrementally
- separate them 
- check assumptions
- consult others

### 1.2elements of programing

describing a language, with three mechanism
- primitive expressions and statements.
- means of combination
- means of abstraction

two kinds of elements: functions and data, but which is not clearly distinct.

expressions/standard lib/names and environment
http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/index.html
python standard lib
from now on to read the instructions from the source and it tells you all about everything want to be familiar with

names can be carried: = assignment /import statement
assignment operator is the simplest means of abstraction.

the interpreter must keep track of the names and that is environment
pure functions and non-pure
 pure is good, in chapter4 chapter 2 will show some non-pure
